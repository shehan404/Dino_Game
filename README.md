This is a recreation of the classic Dinosaur Game from Google Chrome. It's made entirely from scratch.

In this game, you control a dinosaur running through a desert. Your goal is to jump over obstacles like cacties. The longer you run, the faster it gets.

Your score is displayed in the top right corner of the screen. Additionally, the highest score achieved in the current session is also shown. See how high you can score and aim to beat your best record!

It's easy to play â€“ just press the space bar to jump. See how far you can go and try to beat your high score!
